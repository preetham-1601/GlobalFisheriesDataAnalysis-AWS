# GlobalFisheriesDataAnalysis-AWS

## Introduction
Welcome to the *GlobalFisheriesDataAnalysis-AWS* project! This repository contains our team's work on analyzing extensive historical fisheries data, utilizing a range of AWS services. Our goal is to uncover and understand the trends and patterns in global fishing activities from 1950 to 2018, leveraging the power of cloud computing for data processing and visualization. The insights gained through this project aim to contribute to sustainable fishing practices and the conservation of marine ecosystems.
